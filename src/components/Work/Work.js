                So far, I've worked as a <b>software engineer</b> during 3 internships.

                        At <b>Facebook</b>, I worked on their <b>Network Infra team</b>, improving the performance and reliability of a service that generates network device configs. <br />
                The service handled ~3k requests/hour. My work saw a ~10% performance increase, and prevented several SEVs.

                        At <b>JPMorgan</b>, I worked on <b>data modeling</b>, and <b>data engineering at scale</b>. <br />
                This looked like 12,000+ data points with 40+ properties on an hourly basis. <br />
                Dealt with constantly changing business requirements from investment bankers, varying data processing issues (asynchronous fetching on dynamic time cycles), etc.

                        At <b><a href="https://www.sihuatech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sihua Technologies</a></b>,
                I improved the deployment time for their <b>CI/CD</b> pipeline by 70%, but the tool was completely unmanagable, the code was absolute crap, and not used in production.

                        I also run an app development club at Rice called <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://riceapps.org/">RiceApps</a></b>.
                We're about 50 members strong now, and we're building some pretty ambitious projects this year.

                        At Rice, I've served as a <b>TA</b> for a few CS courses (head TA for COMP 322 <b>Parallel Programming</b>, 
                        and COMP 330 <b>Data Science</b>) and had an unfortunately short and hardly significant <b>undergrad research</b> stint in <b>deep learning</b>.
